"""Step 10: run the golden evaluation set against the real pipeline.

For every question: resolve intent through the REAL Azure OpenAI tool-
calling model (not the mock heuristics), execute the resulting call through
the exact same permission-filtered service functions every other caller
uses, and score the result against the question's known-correct answer.

Deliberately does NOT call app.tool_calling.answer() directly. answer()
silently falls back to the mock resolver on any OpenAIError (correct
production behaviour — degrade, don't error) but that would corrupt this
evaluation: a rate-limited call would score as "what the model decided"
when it's actually "what the keyword heuristic guessed," with no way to
tell the two apart afterward. This file re-implements the real-resolution
call with its own retry/backoff instead, so a transient 429 gets retried
rather than silently masked. Same TOOLS/SYSTEM_PROMPT/FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES,
same execute_tool_call() dispatch — just without the silent fallback.

The account's gpt-5-mini deployment is capacity=3 (GlobalStandard, ~3K
TPM) and each call carries ~2.7K tokens of system prompt + 25 few-shot
examples, so this paces itself deliberately slowly.
