"""Independent ground-truth queries for golden_set.py.

Deliberately does NOT call app.people.find_people, app.org_chart.
get_org_chain/_traverse, or app.directory_tools.find_mentor. Those are
exactly what the golden eval grades -- computing "the correct answer"
through the same function that produces "the system's answer" makes any
bug in that function invisible (it agrees with itself no matter what), and
can inject false failures from that function's own non-determinism (an
unordered-by-default DB query feeding a stable sort's tiebreak, e.g.) that
have nothing to do with NL routing quality. This module re-derives each
answer straight from app.models via its own queries/walks, written fresh --
not a copy-paste of the graded function's internals. A disagreement is now
a real signal: either the router picked the wrong tool/arguments, or the
graded function has an actual bug. Never "the same bug on both sides."

is_record_visible (app.permissions) is the one exception, reused rather
than reimplemented: it isn't what this eval grades (routing/retrieval is),
it already has its own dedicated fixture-based suite
(tests/test_visibility.py), and hand-duplicating RBAC/ABAC a second time
here would risk exactly the kind of drift app/registry.py exists to
prevent everywhere else.
