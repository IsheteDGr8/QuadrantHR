"""Step 10: the golden evaluation set.

~50 natural-language questions with known-correct answers, tagged by tier
(1 = direct lookup, 2 = needs interpretation, 3 = multi-step), plus a small
separate batch of out-of-scope/injection checks. Every "known answer" here
is grounded in the actual seeded data (eval/fixture.db — see "Pinned
fixture" below) — verified by querying it directly, not guessed — so
scoring against it is a real correctness check, not a tautology.

Pinned fixture, not live directory.db: this file used to run against
whatever `python seed.py` most recently produced, and every reseed
reshuffled who's who — not just ids (regen_golden_uuids.py handled that),
but names themselves. seed.py's RNG_SEED=42 is fixed, but every feature
seed.py has grown since this file was first built (salary/DOB, IT
division, certifications, ...) consumes additional random() calls before
and during employee generation, shifting the deterministic sequence for
everything downstream — the same seed produces a different name pairing
(e.g. "Chidi" now lands on a different surname entirely), not just
different ids on the same people. A `("independent", ...)` ground truth
computed live against a moving dataset is only as stable as the *names*
the question text and personas below hardcode, and those aren't RNG-stable
across a seed.py edit the way ids alone would be.

The fix is the same one BIRD/Spider use: pin the database. eval/fixture.db
is a committed, frozen SQLite snapshot (force-added past .gitignore's
`*.db` — see scripts/export_fixture.py) that this eval points at
exclusively, never live directory.db. It never changes on its own; only a
deliberate re-export (after confirming every persona/fact below still has
a real anchor in the new snapshot, the way this file's current names were
verified against this one) updates it. This is what makes the
"independent"/"dynamic" mechanisms below actually durable: they stop being
sensitive to reseeds because there are no more reseeds in this file's path,
not because name resolution got any smarter.

Three kinds of ground truth:

  * hardcoded (a plain set[str] of ids/names) — a fact about the data I
    looked up directly (e.g. "who owns the Billing API" -> Diego
    Hernandez's real id). Used for find_project_owner/exact-lookup
    questions, where the correct answer is one fixed fact, not a
    computation. Safe to freeze now specifically because the fixture is
    pinned — a frozen id against a database that never changes again
    doesn't go stale the way one against live directory.db did.

  * independent (an ("independent", fn_name, args) tuple) — resolved via
    eval/independent_truth.py, which recomputes the answer with its own
    SQLAlchemy queries/walks against app.models, never by calling
    find_people/get_org_chain/find_mentor themselves. Those are exactly
    what this eval grades: computing "the correct answer" through the same
    function that produces "the system's answer" makes any bug in that
    function invisible to scoring (it agrees with itself regardless), and
    for find_mentor specifically, made the eval sensitive to that
    function's own non-determinism (an unordered-by-default DB query
    feeding a stable sort's tiebreak) — a source of score noise with
    nothing to do with NL routing quality, previously mistaken for one.
    A disagreement between this and the routed system's actual output is
    now a real signal: either the router picked the wrong tool/arguments,
    or the graded function has an actual bug — never "the same bug on
    both sides." Used for find_people-shaped questions (direct reports,
    org-chain traversal, skill/team/office filters) and find_mentor.

  * dynamic (a ("dynamic", tool_name, args) tuple) — invokes the real
    underlying service function directly (skill_gap/skill_scarcity only,
    as of this fix), with the same caller and the objectively-correct
    arguments, and returns the RAW result object — the runner applies the
    same extractor to it that it applies to the system's own output. Still
    legitimate for these two specifically: the eval isn't grading their
    aggregation math (expert/working/learning counts), there's no
    ranking/ordering step for a self-agreement bug to hide behind, and
    hand-computing the same counts would just be a copy of the aggregation
    itself. find_mentor used to work this way too; it doesn't anymore —
    see "independent" above.

Every question also names an `extractor` (see run_golden_eval.py) that
turns whatever the SYSTEM's tool call returned into the comparable shape
(a set of ids, a single scalar id, or a set of structured dicts) so scoring
is uniform. "dynamic" ground truth reuses that same extractor on its own
raw result; "independent" ground truth returns an already-comparable
set/list directly, since independent_truth.py's functions aren't shaped
like a tool response in the first place.

# find_mentor ground truth is computed independently (eval/independent_truth.py)
# rather than by calling the real find_mentor -- that function is exactly
# what these questions grade, and its result ordering depends on undefined
# SQL row order feeding a stable sort's tiebreak, which had been producing
# score noise unrelated to NL routing quality (see golden_set.py's module
# docstring). skill_gap/skill_scarcity below stay dynamic (calling the real
# service function directly): the eval isn't grading their aggregation math,
# and there's no ranking/ordering step for a self-agreement bug to hide in.
