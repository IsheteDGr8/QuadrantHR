// Stored WITH the API base it was issued against, and discarded on
// mismatch. Employee ids are per-database -- seed.py draws names from a
// fixed RNG seed but ids from uuid4, so the local sqlite file and the
// deployed Azure SQL database hold the same people under different ids.
// A session saved while running against localhost and replayed against

// profile read would 404 with the user apparently logged in fine. That
// exact failure is what frontend/src/identities.ts used to be about.

// sessionStorage, not localStorage, is deliberate: a demo laptop that gets
// closed and reopened should land on the login page, because the login page
// is part of what's being demoed.
