// The team's own org unit on top, its members in a wrapped block directly
// below. Two things differ from DepartmentGraph's tree.
//
// The hub is an org unit, not a person, and it is NOT joined to each member
// by its own elbow connector: teammates are siblings, with no ordering and
// no reporting between them, and once the roster wraps into a grid a
// per-member elbow reads as row 2 reporting to row 1. One trunk from the
// hub into the banded members block says the true thing instead.
//
// Members who manage people DO expand -- a team roster is flat, but the
// people on it need not be, and "who works for this person" was otherwise
// only reachable by re-centring the whole view on them, which loses the
// roster you were reading.
//
// The opened sub-team gets its own full-width band UNDER the roster rather
// than being nested inside the member's grid cell, and only one member is
// open at a time. Nesting it in the cell was the obvious way and it laid
// out badly: one column grew three rows taller than its neighbours, the
// block went from 1164x922 to 1164x1487, and fit-to-view had to drop to 42%
// -- at which point no name on the card is readable. Both blocks stay wide
// and short this way, which is the shape the frame actually is.
