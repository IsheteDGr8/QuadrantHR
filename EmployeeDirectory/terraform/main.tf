        # wiped a manually-set startup command mid-deploy and left the
        # site serving Oryx's placeholder app instead of the real one.
        # Declaring it here makes Terraform's applied state match what
        # the app actually needs, so `terraform apply` stops undoing it.
        #
        # No application_stack block here on purpose: the pinned azurerm
        # provider (~> 3.0, currently 3.117.1) only validates
        # python_version up to "3.12" and doesn't yet know about 3.14,
        # even though Azure itself runs PYTHON|3.14 fine (confirmed
        # live) and this attribute wasn't what actually broke. Adding it
        # would fail `terraform plan` outright. Revisit once the
        # provider adds 3.14 to its accepted values, or bump the
        # provider version deliberately (bigger change, not this fix).
        # Migrations run here, at app startup, NOT from the CI runner. The
        # only SQL firewall rule is AllowAzureServices (0.0.0.0), which is
        # what lets this web app reach the database at all -- a GitHub-hosted
        # runner is not dependably covered by it, so `alembic upgrade head`
        # as a pipeline step would be at the mercy of which IP the runner
        # got. The App Service is already inside that boundary.
        #
        # Chained with `&&` deliberately: if the migration fails, the app
        # does not start, the deploy job's /health poll fails, and the
        # workflow goes red. The alternative -- start anyway on a stale
        # schema -- gives a green deploy serving 500s on every profile page,
        # since /health only does SELECT 1 and would keep passing. Same
        # reasoning as the health-check poll itself: fail loudly rather than
        # leave a silent 503.
        #
        # Idempotent and fast when the database is already at head, which is
        # every deploy that doesn't add a migration.

    # undeclared doesn't mean "don't manage it", it means Terraform wants
    # to null out anything set outside of it -- confirmed live via
    # `terraform plan`, which showed both of these going to `-> null`
    # even though the CI deploy job re-sets them via `az CLI` right after
    # every apply. That ordering was accidentally masking this same bug;
    # declaring them here removes the dependency on job order entirely.
