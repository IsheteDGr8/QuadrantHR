"""The deploy zip's include list is hand-maintained, and has silently
dropped a required file four times now (seed_training.py, seed_people_data.py,
backfill_project_history.py, then config/continuity_thresholds.yml).

Every one of those failed the same way: the deploy went green, /health stayed
200, and the missing piece only surfaced when someone hit the one feature that
needed it. config/ was the worst of the four -- it 500s every /continuity/*
route at request time while the rest of the API stays healthy.

These tests fail the build instead. They assert against the REAL resolved
paths the app reads at runtime, not a second hardcoded list that could drift
out of sync with the first one.

# App settings: the same drift, one layer up.
#
# The zip list decides which FILES reach wwwroot; these two lists decide which
# ENV VARS the app boots with, and they have the same hand-maintained-in-two-
# places problem with a nastier failure mode. terraform/main.tf's app_settings
# block nulls out anything not declared in it (its own comment says so, from a
# `terraform plan` that showed exactly that), and `terraform apply` runs on the
# same push as the deploy job, just before it. So a setting added to only ONE
# of the two lists is not half-configured, it is configured and then wiped --
# and which one wins depends on job order rather than on anything written down.
#
# This is not hypothetical. ALLOW_DEV_AUTH being absent from BOTH lists is what
# took the site down: app/auth.py's assert_dev_auth_is_intentional() started
# refusing to boot without it, and the container crash-looped with a platform
# 503 in front of it until the setting was declared in both places.
