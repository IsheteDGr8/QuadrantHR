"""Everyone edits their OWN skills and languages — and nobody else's.

Three rules, tested independently because they fail independently:

  1. Identity is the gate, not role. An ordinary employee can add, re-level
     and remove entries on their own profile; hr and it get no extra reach
     over anybody else's, which is the half a role-keyed gate would have
     got backwards.
  2. Every write is `self`-sourced. A re-level RE-STAMPS an entry that
     arrived `confirmed`/`certified`, clearing verified_at with it — the
     directory must never show a self-claimed level wearing somebody else's
     attestation.
  3. Skills and languages are one table split by category, so the same
     endpoints serve both, and a name filed under the wrong category is
     refused rather than silently landing in the other card.

Every denial below calls the endpoint directly with whatever role and id it
likes: there is no preceding read to have been filtered and no frontend to
have hidden a button, same standard as tests/test_write_endpoints.py.

    The test database is seeded once per session and shared (see

    EXISTING, shared skills — Terraform, French, Power BI — to throwaway
    people, and tests/test_query_compiler.py asserts a CLOSED SET of who
    holds those ("nobody UNEXPECTED shows up", in its own words). A leaked
    holding is precisely the regression that assertion exists to catch, so
    the fix belongs here rather than in its bounds.

    Removed by employee-id prefix rather than by tracking each write:
    every person this module creates is named "ownskill-*", so the filter
    stays correct as tests are added without anyone having to remember to
    register a teardown. Skills invented along the way (test_unknown_skill_
    name_is_created_under_the_requested_category, and the domain fixture)
    go too — they'd otherwise widen the vocabulary that
    app/text_filters.py reads free text against.

    The employees themselves stay, matching what the other write-test
