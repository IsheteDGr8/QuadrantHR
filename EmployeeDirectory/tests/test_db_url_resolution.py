"""A relative SQLite DATABASE_URL must anchor to the project root, not cwd.

Regression test for a genuinely nasty failure mode: `sqlite:///directory.db`
resolves against the working directory, and SQLite does not error on a
missing file — it creates an empty one. So running anything from a
subdirectory (`cd eval && python run_golden_eval.py`, a seed script,
build_search_index.py) silently produced a brand-new empty database and then
failed several frames later with "no such table: employees", an error that
points at nothing useful and looks like a broken migration.

Pure function tests, no engine construction: app.db builds its engine at
import time from the module-level DATABASE_URL, so the resolution logic is
what's worth pinning down, and it's the part that has to leave Azure SQL and
the test suite's own temp-file URL alone.
