"""Guards for SQLite-vs-Azure-SQL divergences the test suite cannot see.

Every test in this repo runs on SQLite. Azure SQL is stricter in ways SQLite
silently tolerates, so a query can pass all 562 tests and fail the moment it
touches the deployed database. That has now happened twice:

  `.is_(True)`   renders as `IS 1`, which T-SQL rejects outside a NULL
                 comparison. Fixed by convention (`== True`) and documented
                 in comments across app/people.py, app/org_chart.py,
                 app/continuity.py and the operator scripts.

  bare columns   SQLite permits a non-aggregated column in the select list
  in GROUP BY    that isn't in GROUP BY; T-SQL raises error 8120. This is
                 what broke `python seed_continuity.py` on the App Service:

                     Column 'skills.name' is invalid in the select list
                     because it is not contained in either an aggregate
                     function or the GROUP BY clause.

                 Caused by selecting a whole ORM entity while grouping by
                 one of its columns.

These tests assert the invariant structurally, against the real statements,
with no database connection of either kind.
