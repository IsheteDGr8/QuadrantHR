"""Privacy/isolation tests for the continuity feature — ARCHITECTURE_2.md
§14's "indirect security" category, and the continuity design doc's §34-35.

Two questions:
  1. Is WorkAuthorizationRecord structurally unreachable through the general
     query pipeline (never merely policy-blocked)?
  2. Does adding or changing a work-authorization record for a real
     employee move so much as one byte of what any ordinary, non-HR-gated
     ranking returns for them?

(2) is, in both source documents' own words, the single most
differentiating test in this suite.
