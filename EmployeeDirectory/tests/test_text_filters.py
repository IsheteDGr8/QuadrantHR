"""app/text_filters.py -- reading plain free text as a structured
PeopleQuery, using only vocabulary that exists in the database.

Exercised against the real conftest.py fixture data, same as
tests/test_query_compiler.py: offices "Test HQ"/Testville and
"Satellite Office"/"Satellite City"; org units "Engineering",
"Platform Engineering", "Finance Operations"; skills "Terraform",
"Power BI", "French", "Site Reliability Engineering"; job titles
"Software Engineer", "Engineering Manager", "Data Analyst",
"Infrastructure Engineer", "Financial Analyst", "Legal Counsel".

The behaviour these pin down is deliberately conservative: this module
only ever runs after the direct path has already returned nothing, so its
job is to find a real request in the text or get out of the way. Every
test below is either "it found the real values" or "it correctly found
nothing".
