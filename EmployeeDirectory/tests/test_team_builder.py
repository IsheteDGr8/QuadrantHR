"""Tests for app/team_builder.py — the AI Team Builder.

Three things carry the weight here:

  BOUNDARY   a brief is untrusted text that reaches a language model, and
             the pool it staffs from must not move no matter what it says.
             This gets the most tests, including adversarial briefs.
  ARITHMETIC coverage, level weighting and concentration. Every number the
             UI shows is computed here, so an off-by-one becomes a staffing
             decision — the fixture is sized so each expected figure can be
             worked out by hand from the docstring.
  DEGRADATION what happens with no model, no match, or a brief that is not
             a brief at all. All three are normal, none is an error.

The model is stubbed out in every test (`no_model`). Nothing in this file
calls Azure OpenAI: the planner's model path is exercised by feeding
_plan_from_args the arguments a model would have returned, which is the
part worth testing — the validation — without a network dependency.

Fixture data is created and torn down per test function, isolated by a
distinctive id/name prefix, same pattern as tests/test_analytics.py.
