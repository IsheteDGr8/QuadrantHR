"""Phase 2 of ARCHITECTURE_2.md: the org-chain name resolver (§11/RC2).

Before this, get_org_chain required a UUID the model never actually had for
a named third party ("who is above Shaun Anderson, all the way to the
top?"), so multi-hop chain questions about anyone but the caller had no
working path at all. Covers resolve_person_name() directly, the mock
router's chain-phrasing detection, and the end-to-end dispatch through
execute_tool_call. Fixtures: chain-1/2/3 (Chris Bottom -> Charlie Middle ->
Casey Top, tests/conftest.py) and dup-name-1/2 (two "Dana Ambiguous"s).
