"""Mode 3 — semantic project search and the project->employee hop.

Runs with no Azure dependency. The embedding endpoint isn't configured in
the test environment, so embed_texts() returns None and the semantic arm is
simply absent; the keyword arm and the whole hop/ranking/permission path
still run for real. Where a test needs vectors, it writes them directly with
pack_vector() rather than calling Azure — the thing under test is the
ranking and the hop, not the embedding provider.

The permission tests are the important ones. Confidential projects must be
unreachable through this path in TWO independent ways (never embedded, and
filtered on the way out), and a restricted employee must not surface just
because a hop found them via a project everyone can see.
