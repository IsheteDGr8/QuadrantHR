"""Print build_profile_text() output for 20 sample employees, so the search
index's actual content can be eyeballed before Azure credentials exist.

Deliberately includes a few hand-picked edge cases (no bio, no office, a
confidential-project member, a preferred name) ahead of a random
cross-section, rather than a plain LIMIT 20 — a straight limit might not
happen to land on any of the gaps that matter to inspect.
