"""Seed the four Staffing Continuity Intelligence demo cases on top of an
already-seeded directory. Non-destructive add-on, same family as
seed_it_division.py/seed_training.py: seed.py deletes every employee on
each run, so this creates real additional data on top rather than baking
anything into the main reseed.

Why this needs new rows at all, not just new WorkAuthorizationRecord rows:
checked the real distribution directly against a seeded directory.db --
the minimum org-wide Working/Expert holder count for any of the 68 seeded
skills is 8, and the minimum headcount for any employee_projects.role
value is far higher. Nothing in a freshly-seeded directory has the
0 / 1-2 / 3+ backup spread the four demo cases need, so this adds two
narrow skills, three client-engagement projects, and a handful of
background staffing rows, using real existing employees throughout (never
fabricated ones), to construct them.

Builds:
  Case A (High)    — sole holder of a new narrow skill, zero org-wide
                     backups, an open-ended assignment the next HR review
                     intersects.
  Case B (Medium)  — a skill held by exactly 2 people org-wide (1 backup
                     once the at-risk employee is excluded).
  Case C (Low)     — an existing, widely-held skill; ample redundancy.
  Case D (HR-only) — a current, verified record whose next_hr_review_date
                     falls AFTER the assignment's end_date: proves the
                     "none" exposure path, and that HR still sees the
                     person via the employee drill-down even though
                     nothing shows up in the engagement-exposure list.

Each case also gets a superseded predecessor record and a genuinely
pending_verification record, so the current/superseded/pending selection
logic (app/continuity._get_current_authorization_record) has real data to
exercise, not just fixture rows.

    python seed_continuity.py

Idempotent by inspection: if a project named after the first new client
engagement already exists, this does nothing at all.
