"""Document upload -> classify -> typed extraction calls -> staged rows.

The architecture rule the whole module exists to honour: **the model never
touches the database.** It reads text and emits typed function calls. Those
calls are executed here, by Python, and land as `pending` rows in
`doc_subject_matches` (who the document is about) and `proposed_changes`
(what it says about them) — nothing in this file writes to Employee,
EmployeeProject, or EmployeeSkill. That only happens in app/proposals.py,
and only after a human resolves who a row is about and then explicitly
accepts it.

Two-step pipeline, Python-orchestrated rather than agentic: classify, then
extract. The model is never given a choice about the SEQUENCE — it answers
exactly one question per call, Python decides what to ask next based on the
answer, same as every other AI-touching part of this app (see
app/tool_calling.py's `answer()`). The order of steps here is never
actually ambiguous (every document is classified exactly once, then
extracted, with the extraction schema chosen by the classification),
which is what makes a fixed pipeline the right call instead of a
model-driven loop.

Extraction is one STEP but not necessarily one completion: a project doc
names an unknown number of people, and the model chooses for itself how
many of its one-call-per-person calls to fit in a single response —
frequently just the first, which silently lost everyone after them. So
that step continues the conversation until a round emits nobody new,
bounded by MAX_EXTRACTION_ROUNDS. Python still decides that extraction
is what happens after classification; the model only decides when it has
finished naming people.

Name resolution is the interesting part, and it's deliberately NOT a
resolve-or-None decision anymore. A status document says "Priya picked up
the Terraform work"; the directory contains two people called Priya Sharma,
on purpose. rank_candidates() never collapses that to a guess, no matter
how confident a single match looks — it returns every plausible candidate,
ranked, and a human confirms one via app.proposals.resolve_subject. Even an
unambiguous single match is still just the top of a ranked list of one,
not an auto-assignment.

Mock/real follows tool_calling's convention exactly (AI_MODE, falling back
to mock when no chat deployment is configured), so the whole pipeline is
demonstrable and testable with no Azure resources at all.
