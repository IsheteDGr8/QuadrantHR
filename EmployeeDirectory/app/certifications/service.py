"""What the profile actually renders: expectations joined to reported status.

This is the only place the two halves meet. Everything above it (routes,
people.py) sees a list of TrainingStatusItem and has no idea a provider
exists; everything below it (providers, requirements) knows one half each.

Note what is NOT in the output shape: the four-value status. The profile
shows the two-value derivation, per spec — the underlying not_started /
in_progress / failed distinction stays server-side, where the notification
copy needs it.
