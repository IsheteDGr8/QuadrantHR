"""Certification tracking, behind an internal interface.

    base.py          CertificationProvider (the Protocol) + CertStatus (the DTO)
    synthetic.py     SyntheticCertProvider — seeded fake data, powers the demo
    training_api.py  TrainingApiProvider — SHAPE ONLY, never wired (see its
                     module docstring for the three open questions)
    factory.py       get_provider(): picks one, gated on ENABLE_TRAINING_API_SYNC
    requirements.py  which courses are expected of whom (our side, not theirs)
    service.py       joins the two into what a profile renders

Import from this package, not from its modules, wherever practical — the
point of the layout is that callers depend on the interface and never on
which implementation happens to be active.
