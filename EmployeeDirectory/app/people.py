"""find_people and get_person — the only two ways employee data leaves this
service in step 4+. Both follow the same fixed pipeline:

    retrieve -> filter records -> filter fields -> department check
             -> cap results -> write audit_log -> respond

The model (step 9) will call these same two functions and nothing else — it
never touches the database directly, and permission logic never runs inside
the model's reach.

Step 8: find_people's retrieve step now tries Azure AI Search (hybrid
keyword+fuzzy+vector via native RRF) first when there's a name/description
query to rank on, falling back to the plain SQL query when Search isn't
configured, has no query text to work with, or errors.

"Filter records" is no longer a post-retrieval Python step. app.policy.enforce()
is called once per request, and BOTH retrieval paths apply its
required_filters natively before any row comes back — the SQL branch via
app.query_compiler.apply_filter on its own Select, the Search branch by
translating the same obligations into an OData filter (app/search_client.py's
_build_filter). Search still never sees the caller's identity or role and
never makes its own visibility decision — it only compiles whatever decision
enforce() already made into its own filter syntax, same division of
responsibility as before, just enforced earlier. is_record_visible/
visible_fields (app/permissions.py) are no longer called anywhere in this
file; app.policy.excluded_by_obligations/compute_visible_fields replace them,
driven by the same enforce() decision. See this repo's migration notes for
why app/permissions.py itself is untouched — those two functions remain the
live gate for app/directory_tools.py and app/notifications.py, a separate,
deferred scope.

    """The model-emitted-PeopleQuery retrieval path (Piece 2) -- find_people's
    named-parameter tool stays exactly as it is for the deterministic router
    and the common cases; this is what the LLM fallback reaches for on a
    request find_people's fixed parameters can't express ("Bangalore or
    Singapore", "title contains Architect", any filter combination nobody
    anticipated in advance). validate() -> snap() -> enforce() -> compile ->
    respond, same pipeline shape as every other retrieval in this file, just
    driven by a caller-constructed plan instead of named kwargs.

    SQL only, deliberately -- app.query_plan.PeopleQuery's own docstring
    already says it: "Deliberately cannot express free-text ranking...
    reverted by mode 1". There's no query-text field anywhere on this
    shape, so there is never anything for Azure Search to rank against
    here, and find_people's own established rule is that a pure-filter
    request with nothing to rank skips Search entirely regardless. A
    Search-side compiler for this would have been dead code -- exactly the
    non-goal ARCHITECTURE_2.md §16 already names.

    validate()/enforce() failures raise ValueError, deliberately, so
    execute_with_retry's existing bounded retry loop (app/tool_calling.py)
    catches them for free -- no new retry mechanism needed. The two are
    NOT given the same message treatment. validate()'s structural errors
    (unknown field, illegal op, wrong value type) are safe to surface
    verbatim -- they don't reveal anything about data sensitivity, only
    about the plan's own legal shape. enforce()'s denial is different:
    ARCHITECTURE_2.md §8's own rule is that "a denial must not reveal that
    a restricted capability exists" (decision.reason is for the audit log,
    never the caller), and _retry_after_execution_failure() feeds this
    exception's message straight back to the model as part of the retry
    prompt -- so a denial raises a generic message instead of
    decision.reason, never naming the field it actually tripped on.

    snap()'s unresolvable values (SnapNote.resolved is None) are NOT
    treated as an error to retry -- retrying won't fix a value that
    genuinely isn't in the database, same reasoning find_people's own
    unresolvable skill/org_unit filters already follow (an empty result,
    not an exception -- see tests/test_query_compiler.py's
    test_unresolvable_*_returns_nothing_not_an_error). The unresolved value
    is passed through as-is (snap() already does this substitution
    internally), so compile_query() naturally returns zero rows for it.
    The notes are folded into the audit query_text so they stay traceable;
    a richer "did you mean X?" surfaced back to the caller is a real future
    enhancement, not built in this pass.
