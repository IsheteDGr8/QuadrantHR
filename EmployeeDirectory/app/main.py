# One endpoint family covers both cards: a language is a skills row with
# category=language (app/own_skills.py), so the Languages card posts
# category="language" and everything else is identical.

# All three answer with the caller's full PersonDetail rather than the row

# instead of the 204 DELETE /people/{id}/projects/{project_id} returns. An
# add doesn't always land in the card that submitted it (category belongs
# to the skill), so the response has to be able to show where it went, and
# the caller is looking at their own profile page anyway.
