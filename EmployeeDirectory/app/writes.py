"""Write paths for hr (internal employee fields) and it (project
descriptions).

Enforcement lives HERE, not in the route. The route is one caller; the
tool-calling layer, a future batch import, and any test that calls the
service directly are others, and a rule that only exists in a FastAPI
decorator is a rule that only applies to callers who happen to come through
FastAPI. Every function below re-derives (role, view_mode) permission from
app.permissions' EDITABLE table before touching a row — the read that the UI
performed first is not evidence of anything.

Each write follows the same four steps, in this order:

    1. authorize (role + view_mode + field, from the table)
    2. persist
    3. re-index (rule 6)
    4. audit

Audit last and unconditionally: a write that succeeded and then failed to
re-index is still a write that happened, and the audit row is what says so.

One READ lives here too — list_deactivated_employees. It sits with the
lifecycle functions rather than in app/people.py because every read path in
that module treats is_active=False as nonexistent (deliberately), and it's
gated by the same EDITABLE capability as deactivate/reactivate rather than
by directory visibility. Putting it next to find_people/get_person would
place a function whose whole job is to surface inactive records beside
functions whose whole contract is that they don't.
