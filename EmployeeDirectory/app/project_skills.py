"""Project skill requirements: which skills (and minimum level) a project's
delivery actually needs, as recorded by whoever owns the project or HR.

This is what lets app/continuity.py's delivery-dependency calculation tell
a real requirement apart from a heuristic. Without a row here for a given
project, that calculation falls back to its previous behavior — treating
every Working/Expert skill an assigned employee happens to hold as a
candidate dependency — which overcounts: a skill on someone's profile that
this particular engagement never needed still showed up as a "dependency".
See app/schemas.py's DeliveryDependency.source for how that distinction
surfaces in the API.

Not sensitive data — unlike work-authorization records, there's no
isolation requirement here. Visibility follows the same confidentiality
rule as everywhere else in this app (confidential projects: members and hr
only). Write access is narrower: only the project's owner, or hr — there's
no existing "project owner can edit their project" pattern elsewhere in
this codebase, so this introduces the smallest version of one rather than
gating writes behind hr alone, since a project's actual skill requirements
are usually known by whoever runs it, not by HR.

    this exact confidentiality check rather than duplicating it, since the

    HR's blanket exemption for confidential projects is a role privilege, so
    it collapses in employee mode like every other one (effective_role) — it
    used to read caller.role directly, which let an hr caller keep seeing a
    confidential project's requirements while claiming to be looking at the
    ordinary-colleague view. Membership is untouched by the mode: it's an
    ABAC grant keyed on identity, and those deliberately survive employee
    mode (README, "ABAC survives employee mode"), so somebody actually
    staffed on the project still sees it either way.
