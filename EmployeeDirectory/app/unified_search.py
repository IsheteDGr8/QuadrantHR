"""Unified search: merges the structured /people path and the model-backed
/ask path behind one endpoint and one discriminated response shape, for the
Search+Ask UI merge. The frontend is a pure renderer — this module is what
actually decides "direct" vs "assisted", deterministically, with no model
call for the direct case.

That decision is intentionally narrow — question SHAPE (a trailing question
mark or an interrogative opener) or a described PROBLEM (see
needs_assistant) — not a model call and not fuzzy NLU. A missed
classification just falls through to find_people's own free-text hybrid
search rather than erroring, so a false negative degrades gracefully
instead of failing outright.

The problem half was added after mode 3 shipped: question shape alone
excluded exactly the phrasing find_experts exists to serve, because a
described problem is a statement, not a question.

Wraps find_people (app.people) and resolve_intent/execute_with_fallback
(app.tool_calling) rather than duplicating either's retrieval or
permission-filtering logic — every person that ends up in `results` or
`overview.citations` already passed through is_record_visible exactly once,
inside whichever of those two functions actually produced it. Nothing in
this module re-decides visibility; it only reshapes already-filtered data
for the frontend to render.

         request being free, though: _build_assisted's phrase_answer()

      AMBIGUOUS / UNKNOWN NAME

        can answer. The prompt IS the answer here; there is nothing for a
        model to add to it.

        Empty means "nobody there" OR "that direction is restricted for

        were found for Kenji Hernandez." He has eight; the same question
        as HR returns all of them. That is not a phrasing preference, it
        is the app stating something false about the organisation.
