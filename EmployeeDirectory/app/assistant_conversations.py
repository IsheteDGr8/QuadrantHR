"""Server-side persistence for the two chat assistants (search and PRD).

Store the plans, not the answers: app.schemas.HistoryTurn already carries
exactly the right shape and discipline for one turn (message, tool_call,
arguments, assistant_text), and app.tool_calling._history_messages()
re-executes tool_call/arguments fresh through the enforce()-gated
dispatcher on every new turn rather than trusting a stored result -- so a
field revoked between when a turn was written and when it's replayed is
simply absent on replay. Persisting a conversation is persisting
AssistantTurn rows in that exact shape and nothing more; this module is
the only place that reads/writes AssistantConversation/AssistantTurn.

Ownership, not role: a caller may only ever see their OWN conversations.
A conversation_id that exists but belongs to someone else is a 404, same
as one that doesn't exist at all -- never a 403, which would confirm the
id refers to something real.
