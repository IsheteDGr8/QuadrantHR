"""Validator and vocabulary snapper (ARCHITECTURE_2.md §9). Two different
jobs, deliberately not merged into one function:

  * validate() rejects on STRUCTURE -- the plan itself is malformed
    (unknown field, illegal operator for that field, wrong value type, or a
    field that's registered but unlabelled and therefore can never appear
    in any plan regardless of role -- see app/registry.py's `sensitivity =
    None` case). Structural problems are reject, never guess.

  * snap() corrects on VALUES -- a real, legal field/operator combination
    whose value doesn't exactly match what's in the database
    ("Cloud Infrastructure" -> "Infrastructure", ARCHITECTURE_2.md's own
    RC4 example). Value problems are snap, never reject outright; an
    unresolvable value is reported, not silently dropped.

Role plays no part in either function here. Unlabelled-field rejection in
validate() is role-independent by construction (personal_mobile can never
appear in a plan for ANY role -- app/registry.py is explicit that it's
only ever reachable through the separate ABAC post-retrieval mechanism).
Per-role visibility for labelled fields is enforce()'s job (app/policy.py),
not this module's -- keeping "is this plan well-formed" and "is this
caller allowed to ask it" as two separate questions, not one blurred check.
