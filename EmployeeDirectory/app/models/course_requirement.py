    """Company-side expectation: which courses apply to which people.

    This is the row that lets the profile distinguish "hasn't done X" from
    "X was never expected of them" — without it, an absent status is
    ambiguous and every employee looks non-compliant on every course in the
    catalogue.

    Scope is expressed as a conjunction of optional narrowing clauses; a
    clause left NULL means "don't narrow on this". All-NULL is a legitimate,
    deliberate row: company-wide, everyone.

      org_unit_id       applies to this unit AND everything under it, so a
                        requirement can be filed once at division level
                        instead of once per team. (Employees only ever sit in
                        their most-specific unit — same subtree problem
                        find_people's org_unit filter solves, resolved here by
                        walking *up* from the employee instead of down from
                        the unit; see app/certifications/requirements.py.)
      job_title_keyword case-insensitive substring of job_title. The schema
                        has no "role" or "track" column to key off — title is
                        the only role signal that exists, so "Manager" is how
                        a leadership-track requirement gets expressed.
      employment_type   e.g. compliance training expected of fte only, not
                        contractors.

    Why not a `track` column on Employee: adding one would mean inventing
    track values for ~500 synthetic employees and a second place for them to
    drift out of sync with org_unit/job_title. If HR later owns a real track
    taxonomy, it becomes one more optional clause here, not a rewrite.

    # Both nullable, and both NULL is the honest default: a requirement with
    # no deadline is never overdue, and the dashboard says "no deadline set"
    # rather than inventing one. Nothing in the training system reports a due
    # date to us, so this is the company-side half of the deadline the same
    # way the clauses above are the company-side half of "who".

    # Two columns because compliance training genuinely comes in two shapes
    # and collapsing them loses one:
    #
    #   due_date            a fixed org-wide deadline — "everyone completes
    #                       the FY26 security refresh by 30 Sep". The same
    #                       date for every person the requirement scopes to.
    #   due_days_after_hire a rolling per-person deadline — "within 30 days
    #                       of joining". Resolves against Employee.hire_date,
    #                       so each person has their own.
    #
    # A row may set either, or both: with both, the EARLIER of the two wins
    # (see app/certifications/requirements.py's course_due_dates), which is
    # what "within 30 days of joining, and in any case before the FY close"
    # means. Resolution lives there, not here — two requirement rows can name
    # the same course, and only the resolver sees all of them at once.
