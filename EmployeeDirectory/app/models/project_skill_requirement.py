    This is what lets app/continuity.py's delivery-dependency calculation
    tell a real requirement apart from a heuristic: without a row here for
    a given project, that calculation falls back to treating every
    Working/Expert skill an assigned employee happens to hold as a
    candidate dependency, which overcounts (a skill on someone's profile
    that this engagement never actually needed still shows up). Each
    computed DeliveryDependency is tagged "declared" or "inferred"
    accordingly -- see app/schemas.py's DeliveryDependency.source.
