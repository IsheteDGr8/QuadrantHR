"""Field visibility as a config dictionary, not scattered if-statements.

RBAC sets the base field list per (role, view_mode). ABAC adds fields where
the caller's relationship to the target warrants it (e.g. their own profile,
or a direct report). A department check can further strip
department-sensitive fields. None of this touches the database —
is_record_visible() / visible_fields() are pure functions over
already-retrieved rows, applied strictly after retrieval.

Deny by default: a field absent from ALLOWED for a (role, view_mode) pair is
never returned, full stop, regardless of any other rule.

VIEW MODES
----------
Every role sees the directory through one of two lenses:

    work      — the caller's full privileges. What every role got before
                view modes existed, so "work" is the behaviour-preserving
                mode and the default for internal callers.
    employee  — the ordinary-colleague view. Output is identical no matter
                who is looking, so an hr caller can see exactly what the
                directory looks like to the people in it.

Only hr may choose; resolve_view_mode() forces employee mode for
everyone else regardless of what the client asked for. Employee mode is
enforced in three places, not one — the field table below, the record-level
check, and the department check — because each is a separate stage of the
pipeline and any one of them left role-aware would leak a privileged
caller's identity back into a view that is supposed to be anonymous.
