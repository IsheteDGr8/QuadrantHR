"""Requirements captured for a project: skill requirements live in
app/project_skills.py (ProjectSkillRequirement, unchanged by this module);
this one owns the qualitative half (ProjectRequirementNote) plus the reads
that combine both for the PRD assistant and its picker page.

Not added to app/project_skills.py itself -- that module's own docstring
frames its HR-or-owner write gate as the smallest version of a new
pattern, "not something to casually extend"; this is a second module that
reuses its visible_project confidentiality check rather than growing it.

Notes get a STRICTER read gate than skills. get_required_skills (existing,
untouched) stays open to anyone who can see the project -- structured org
facts, no different from any other project attribute. Requirement notes
are sentences lifted verbatim from a planning document, so reading them
uses the same HR-or-owner gate the write path does; leaving that open
would make every other HR gate in this feature control convenience rather
than access, since any employee could read the same notes by calling this
route directly.
