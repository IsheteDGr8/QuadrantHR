"""Two independent triggers off one status-change event.

    employee reminder    fires whenever display_status is not_completed.
                         Wording depends on the UNDERLYING status — that's
                         the whole reason the four-value enum survives into
                         the database instead of being collapsed to two.
    management report    fires on a status *resolution* (completed, or
                         not_completed after an actual attempt), and walks
                         the full reporting chain, not just the direct
                         manager. Says "completed" or "did not complete" and
                         never more: pass/fail is between the employee and
                         the training system.

ORDERING (explicit, not incidental)
-----------------------------------
The employee's own notification is created first and carries sequence 0; the
chain follows at 1..n, ordered by distance up the tree. Both are written in
one transaction and committed together, so the guarantee is "the employee is
told before, or at the same instant as, their management" — never after.

This matters most in the failed case: finding out you didn't pass by way of
your skip-level manager asking about it is a bad day at work. Leaving the
order to whichever subscriber a dispatcher happened to call first would make
that a coin flip, so there is no dispatcher and no subscribers — one
function, in one order, with the order persisted on the row (`sequence`)
rather than inferred from created_at, which is only millisecond-resolution
and would leave ties unresolved.

PERMISSIONS
-----------
Every notification goes through _may_receive(), which asks the same
app.permissions functions the profile API asks. Nothing here calls a mailer
or a Slack client directly — _deliver() is the single seam a real transport
plugs into, and it is downstream of the permission check, not around it. A
recipient who could not see the field on the profile does not get told about
it in a notification either.
