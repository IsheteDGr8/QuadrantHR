"""Compiles a PeopleQuery + PolicyDecision into a read-only, parameterized
SQLAlchemy query over Employee rows (ARCHITECTURE_2.md §11, Phase 3 Round
2): approved columns only, parameterized values throughout (every value
comes from Filter.value or a resolved id, never string-formatted into SQL),
a hard row cap from the policy decision. No writes -- this module only ever
returns a SELECT.

This is the one place a PeopleQuery becomes SQL. compile_query() applies
`decision.required_filters` (obligations) exactly like the plan's own
filters -- appended unconditionally, never negotiable by the caller, since
they were never on the plan the model saw in the first place.

Field coverage matches app/registry.py's *filterable* set today: id,
full_name, preferred_name, org_unit, work_email, office, availability_status,
skills, languages. The org_unit hierarchy walk and skill/language resolution
mirror app.people's existing `_org_unit_and_descendant_ids` /
`resolve_skill` (same recursive-CTE / synonym-following shape) -- ported
here as this module's own copy rather than imported, since this is meant to
become the canonical version find_people's structured-filter branch adopts
later, not a second implementation that has to agree with a first one
forever. find_people keeps its own copies until that migration happens;
this module changes nothing about find_people's current behavior.
