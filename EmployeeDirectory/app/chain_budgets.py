"""Per-plan-class chain budgets (Conversational Assistant plan, "Steps is
the wrong single axis"). A chain's budget was one constant
(MAX_CHAIN_STEPS) applied everywhere; this replaces it with three
independently-exhausted axes, declared per plan class rather than chosen
by the model or hardcoded in execute_chain:

  steps             reasoning depth, and the cost of a confused plan
  max_records       exposure -- the dimension cross-query inference
                     actually runs along; a handful of broad queries can
                     return more than twenty narrow ones
  max_wall_clock_ms the user's time, and the blast radius of a slow
                     dependency

Whichever axis is exhausted first ends the chain -- execute_chain checks
all three every step, not just the step count. An absolute ceiling bounds
every plan class regardless of what it declares, so a misconfigured entry
can never produce an unbounded loop; assert_chain_budgets_within_ceiling()
(called at startup, app/main.py's _lifespan) fails loudly if a declared
budget ever exceeds it on any axis -- the same "a real deploy must say
what it means, checked before it ever serves a request" shape
assert_registry_covers_schema and assert_dev_auth_is_intentional already
hold elsewhere in this app.

This turns the constant into actual bounded-autonomy infrastructure: a
plan class that genuinely needs a longer chain (the doc's example --
"staff the Meridian engagement", whose step count can't be known in
advance) gets one via a registry entry here, not a code change to
execute_chain, and it still can't exceed CEILING however it's declared.
There is exactly one plan class today -- the general model-routed chain
reachable from /ask and /search's assisted mode -- so this is currently
one dict with one entry, not several; the shape is what makes a second
plan class a registry edit later instead of a new code path.

The PRD assistant (app.tool_calling.PRD_PROFILE) is that second plan
class -- the change that proves the claim above. Its own entry,
"prd_chain", needed no change to execute_chain itself: only a registry
entry and a profile that points at it.
