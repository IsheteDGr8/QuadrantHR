"""Pluggable caller authentication.

Both providers resolve to the same AuthenticatedUser shape, so every route
downstream (find_people, get_person, ...) depends only on get_current_user
and never knows or cares whether the caller came in via a dev header or a
real Entra ID token. That's what makes swapping in real credentials later a
config change, not a code change.

AUTH_MODE selects the provider explicitly ("dev" or "entra"). Left unset, it
auto-detects: "entra" once ENTRA_TENANT_ID and ENTRA_CLIENT_ID are both
present, "dev" otherwise — so the API runs with zero Azure setup from day
one, per the project's credentials-arrive-late constraint.

# "it" is the IT department's role: the people who administer the directory

# app-role claim) and is never stored on Employee — see app/config.py's
# hr_org_unit_name for why the org tree is only ever the fallback signal, in
# contexts that have no request to read a claim from.
#
# It is NOT a privileged role. It used to be — it could edit project
# descriptions and review AI-extracted changes — and both of those moved to
# hr, on the reasoning that administering the system that holds people's
# records is not the same as owning the records. An "it" caller now sees and
# writes exactly what an "employee" caller does; hr is the only privileged
# role left. See app/permissions.py's ALLOWED and EDITABLE tables.
