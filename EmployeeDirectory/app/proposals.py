"""Review workflow for AI-extracted changes. HR only, work mode only.

Two stages, two staging tables. app/doc_extraction.py creates both
doc_subject_matches (who a document mentions) and proposed_changes (what it
says about them) as `pending`/`unresolved` — nothing there commits, and
nothing here runs without a reviewer's explicit action:

  1. resolve_subject() answers "who is this person" — confirms one of the
     ranked candidates, or marks the row a new-hire candidate for HR. Until
     this runs, every proposed_changes row under that subject has
     employee_id = NULL and is invisible to list_proposals.
  2. accept() / edit() answer "is this specific field claim true" — the
     only two functions in this module that write to a real table
     (EmployeeSkill, EmployeeProject). reject() and reassign() never do.

The invisible-until-accepted guarantee is structural rather than enforced by
a filter: a pending row lives in `proposed_changes`, a table that
build_profile_text has never heard of and that no retrieval path queries. It
becomes searchable at exactly the moment accept()/edit() writes it into a
real table and re-indexes — not before, and not by anyone forgetting a
WHERE clause.
