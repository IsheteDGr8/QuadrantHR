"""The field registry: one source of truth for every field this API can
ever select, filter, or sort on, and how sensitive it is. ARCHITECTURE_2.md
§5. Everything downstream (app/query_plan.py's Field Literal, app/policy.py's
enforce()) reads from REGISTRY — there is no second list of field names
anywhere else that could drift out of sync with it.

Sensitivity tiers are a direct relabeling of app/permissions.py's existing
BASE_FIELDS/INTERNAL_FIELDS (named HR_ONLY_FIELDS before view modes and the
"it" role were introduced there — same five fields, renamed on that side,
not re-derived on this one), not a new judgment call about what's sensitive
— see the per-field comments below for the mapping. Deliberately only two
populated tiers (INTERNAL, HR_ONLY): every field gets a tier and goes
through the identical is_visible() check, including `id` and `full_name`
— there is no "public" tier that skips the check.

app/permissions.py's ABAC exceptions don't fit this static (role, view_mode)
model at all — "who comes back" isn't known until the query runs, so they
stay exactly where they already are, applied post-retrieval, on top of
whatever this registry says statically:

  * personal_mobile (self or direct manager): registered anyway (every
    real column must be, per assert_registry_covers_schema below) but with
    sensitivity=None — the static registry always denies it for
    select/filter/order_by, and the only way it ever reaches a response is
    permissions.abac_extra_fields's post-retrieval grant, entirely outside
    this system.
  * salary / salary_currency / date_of_birth (self only, layered on a REAL
    HR_ONLY tier, not sensitivity=None): hr sees these statically, same as
    hire_date/cost_centre — that part IS a mechanical relabeling. The
    additional "the record's own subject can also see their own" grant is
    the same post-retrieval ABAC mechanism as personal_mobile, just added
    on top of a populated tier instead of an empty one. This registry only
    ever governs the RBAC floor; it was never the whole visibility story
    for any field ABAC touches.

`direct_reports` (PersonSummary/OrgChainNode's downward-chain field,
manager+hr only) and `training_status` (own profile, or anywhere in the
target's upward reporting chain, per permissions.training_extra_fields)
are deliberately NOT registered here. Both are governed by an inline
check elsewhere (app/people.py/app/org_chart.py; app/permissions.py),
not by a static per-role sensitivity tier — there's no existing tier to
relabel for "manager and hr, but not employee" or "self and your whole
reporting chain, but no one else," and inventing one is a real design
decision, not a mechanical relabeling pass. Flagged here as known gaps
rather than silently folded into INTERNAL (visible to employee too —
wrong for both) or HR_ONLY (invisible to manager/chain — also wrong for
both). Neither is a real `employees` column, so neither trips
assert_registry_covers_schema's drift check either.
